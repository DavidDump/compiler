foo :: struct { ... }; // what is the type of foo?
// it should be type

bar :: u8;
// but this is also type

// how do you differentiate between these two cases in TypeInfo??

// TYPE_STRUCT_DEF should be TYPE_USER_DEFINED
// and have a union with the enum typeInfo and struct typeInfo as those two will probably be the only two i have


// TYPE_STRUCT_LIT should be just TYPE_STRUCT this is a struct literal and it stored the type of it
